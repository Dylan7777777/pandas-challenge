# pandas-challenge

This would have been a very challenging project if not for the guidance with the hint of the python file. With Pandas the sheer going back and forth makes it a lot easier to understand with time where the errors are and correct them. 

There were two major issues I encountered - one was the groupby as I realized there was a line missing in the starter code to groupby school name.

The second issues while a minor one is the formatting of per student budget. If I format it with a $ sign then i can't bin the  scores by school spending.
